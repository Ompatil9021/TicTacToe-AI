# TicTacToe-AI (Unbeatable AI using Minimax + Alpha–Beta Pruning)

This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game where the human player **cannot defeat the AI**.  
The AI is powered by the **Minimax algorithm** enhanced with **Alpha–Beta pruning**, making it optimal, fast, and unbeatable.

The backend is built using **Flask (Python)**, and the frontend is rendered using HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🧠 AI Logic (Minimax + Alpha–Beta)

The AI evaluates all possible game states using the **Minimax** algorithm, ensuring it always chooses the optimal move.  
To improve speed, **Alpha–Beta pruning** removes branches that don’t need evaluation, allowing lightning-fast decisions.

### Evaluation Rules:
- AI (`O`) win → **+10**
- Player (`X`) win → **–10**
- Draw → **0**
