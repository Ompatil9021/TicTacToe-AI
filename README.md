# TicTacToe-AI

Simple Tic Tac Toe web app (Flask) with frontend under `static/` and a main app in `app.py`.

How to run locally:

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you have one, otherwise install Flask

2. Run the app

   set FLASK_APP=app.py; flask run

Note: This repo includes a `venv/` directory in the workspace; it's recommended to remove it before pushing or add it to .gitignore (already added).

Remote repo may have had a README already; this file contains the merged contents.
